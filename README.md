# Linear Regression From Scratch

This project implements **linear regression** with only the use of the **NumPy** library. The goal is to demonstrate a clear understanding of the mathematical underlying sof linear regression without reliance upon high-level libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

The implementation supports training (fitting) a model, and predicting.
